# Discord Bot Template

A versatile and easy-to-use template for building Discord bots
with [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/).
This template is designed to help you kickstart your bot development
with pre-configured commands, events, and best practices.
```
## Features
- Modular command and event handling
- Built-in error handling
- Supports Slash Commands
- Customizable configuration
- Written in JavaScript using Discord.js

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.9.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/))

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KanamiYBH/bot-discord
   cd bot-discord
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your bot token:
   ```env
   TOKEN=your-bot-token
   BOT_ID=your-bot-id
   ```
4. Start the bot:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
### Command Structure
Commands are stored in the `commands` folder. Each command follows this structure:
```javascript
const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require("discord.js");

module.exports = {
    category: 'category',
    data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
        .setName('command-name')
        .setDescription('command-description'),
    async execute(interaction) {
        // Command logic
    }
};
```

### Event Handling
Events are stored in the `events` folder. They are registered dynamically at runtime.
